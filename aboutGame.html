    <div class="bigBox">
        In "Accounting for Time," players step into the worn-out shoes of Daryl, an office worker trapped in a cycle of abuse under the tyranny of his boss,
        Mr. X. Daryl's days are filled with menial tasks, belittlement, and constant criticism, leaving him demoralized and exhausted.
        However, Daryl discovers an unexpected escape from his torment: his dreams.<br />
        <br />
        <br />


        "Accounting for Time" is not just a game but a poignant narrative experience that explores themes of oppression, self-discovery, and the power of the human spirit.
        Through its immersive gameplay and heartfelt storytelling, it invites players to embark on a journey of introspection and triumph, inspiring them to confront their own demons and emerge stronger on the other side.
